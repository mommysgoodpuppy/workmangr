# Changelog (Canonical Workman Manual)

This changelog records semantic changes to the canonical Workman manual.

Guidelines:
- Every entry should mention which section changed and whether it is breaking.
- If behavior was previously unspecified and becomes defined, record that too.

## Unreleased

- Initial manual skeleton added and organized into numbered folders.
